# RL-Grid-World
Practise project to jolt RL memory. Planning on formulating MDP &amp; using GPI for solving optimality

I'm using this project to reacquaint my self with reinforcement learning. I plan on creating a 
simple GridWorld application & experimenting with how the agent & environment interact.
I shall be using tabular data & dynamic programming. This is designed, or going to be, 
to be simple. This is before I venture into temporal difference learning & 
Monte Carlo Methods. Dynamic programming establishes a strong base for these, &
so I want to have a proepr unstanding of the fundamentals beforehand.

This project, while simple, is meant to be perfectly accurate. Sound reasoning should
be present for everything. Improvement iterations should be tracked - along with their
reason.
