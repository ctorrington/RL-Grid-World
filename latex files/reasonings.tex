\section{Reasonings}
\subsection{Overall}
This problem provides a perfect model of the environment as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), \& so I shall use Dynamic Programming algorithms to 
compute the optimal policies. This is an episodic task as the agent can 
complete the game once it reaches the terminal states. This allows the problem 
to be modelled as as finte MDP.
