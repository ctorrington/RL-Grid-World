commit 6c9b727
I changed the policy function to a dictionary rather than a 3D numpy array.
I used the numpy array because it was similar to a Tensorflow tensor, something
that I'm vaguely familiar with. However, the numpy array was unecessarily large
for the problem & a dictionary was better able to fit the structure. Now, 
rather than having an array of shape [10, 10, 4], a dictionary maps each state
to an action according to the policy. While is not identical to how it is done
mathematically with sets, I do believe that it makes more sense programmaticaly.
